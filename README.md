MLTools
======================

MLtools aims at providing tools for solving the hand-written digits pattern recognition problem (MNIST). MLTools implement two celebrated Machine Learning techniques:

- A Multi-Layer Perceptron performing Stochastic Gradient descent optimization on a Logistic Error function. 
- A Sequential minimal optimization Support Vector Machine algorithm. 

We then apply both solutions to the MNIST dataset and compare the results.
