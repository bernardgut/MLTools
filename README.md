MLP : Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm for Machine Learning
======================

MLtools aims at providing tools for solving the hand-written digits pattern recognition problem (MNIST). MLTools implement two celebrated Machine Learning techniques:

  A Stochastic Gradient descent optimization on a Logistic Error function on a Multi-Layer Perceptron, 
  SMO support vector machine algorithm. 

We then apply both solutions to the MNIST dataset and compare the results.
